## Information

The [project](https://github.com/users/smamusa/projects/4/views/1) is to create a Java console application which would enable the user to scrape all currency exchange rates in Croatian banks.

Future plans include development of an API with a background job running once per day, scraping the data and feeding it to a RDBMS and then serving it through an API thus creating a historical reference.

If you want to be included in the project please provide your information on the [discussions page](https://github.com/smamusa/exchange-rate-scraper/discussions/categories/project-access-requests)
